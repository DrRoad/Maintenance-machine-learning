# PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE USING MACHINE LEARNING

Performance of different machine learning algorithms for classification in predictive maintenance.

Classes:

*  1: Failure of the machine within 30 days or less
*  0: No failure within 30 days or less

Prediction of the machine learning algorithms are compared based on:

* Training Accuracy
* Testing Accuracy
* ROC AUC

Additionally two different performance plots:

* Validation curve
* Reciever operating characteristic
